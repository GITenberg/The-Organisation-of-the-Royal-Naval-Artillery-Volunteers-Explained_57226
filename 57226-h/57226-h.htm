<div class='sidenote'>Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers.</div>
<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>It has been thought desirable to publish the following
statement, for the purpose of giving some explanation
of the services, duties, privileges, and general organisation
of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How to be recruited.</div>
<p class='c004'>In inviting persons to enrol themselves in the corps,
the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty desire to
extend the volunteer movement, so successfully established
as an auxiliary to the land forces, to the defence
of this country by sea. The proposal is novel and unprecedented
in its character. In any other country
than our own, it would, in all probability, be visionary.
In England, however, we possess a guarantee for the
success of such an undertaking, which cannot be found
elsewhere. A taste for maritime pursuits pervades
this insular nation, and the hope may therefore be confidently
entertained that the appeal, now made to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>patriotism of the nautical and aquatic sections of the
community, will not be urged in vain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Naval opinions in favour of such a force.</div>
<p class='c004'>Eminent naval authorities have, for many years
past, recommended the formation of a corps, for the
purposes of coast defence, composed of persons who,
while not possessing the wider experience of the seaman,
are accustomed to the management of boats, and
in the constant habit of going afloat. The Act for the
Royal Navy Artillery Volunteers, passed in the last
session at the instance of the Admiralty, and the regulations
recently issued under that Act, afford the most
convincing proof that, in the estimation of those who
are actually responsible for the efficiency of the naval
service, such a force is desirable. The concurrence of
the naval members of the late administration in the
various steps which have been taken, may likewise be
quoted, in order to show that there is a general desire,
among those to whom the welfare of the navy is an
especial object of solicitude, for the success of the
movement, which it is the object of the present writer
to explain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The harbour defence only.</div>
<p class='c004'>It has been already stated that coast defence, and
not service at sea, constitutes the especial sphere proposed
for the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers. The
term coast defence is perhaps, in a certain sense, a misnomer.
The defence of the most important of our
commercial harbours against an attack from the sea
could not be effectually conducted by a force composed
exclusively of men trained for the land service alone.
The approach to all the great ports of the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Kingdom from the sea involves the navigation of extensive
estuaries, where floating batteries, and armed
rafts, and the use of torpedoes, are essential to a complete
defence, and would in point of fact effectually
prevent the nearer approach of a hostile fleet. In the
laying out of torpedoes on an extensive scale, a flotilla
of boats would be required; and in furnishing crews
for such boats, the well-trained oarsmen, who, it is
hoped, will be found willing to enroll themselves in
the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers, would be enabled
to render valuable service. In all probability, by their
co-operation in the hour of danger, they would release
an equal number of highly trained seamen, who would
form the crews of sea-going cruisers. All our greatest
ports, London, Hull, Newcastle, Leith and Granton,
ports for Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bristol, Southampton,
Belfast, Dublin, Cork, are situated at the head of an
extensive estuary, or at some distance from the mouth
of a navigable river. The mere enumeration of these
names is sufficient to show how large a sphere there
might be, in the event of a threatened invasion, for
the employment, in the important and essential task of
harbour defence, of an auxiliary force composed, not
of trained seamen, but of persons who may be described
generally as aquatics.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is to be observed that a mere oarsman, although
not trained at the great guns, or in the use of rifle and
cutlass, would be enabled to do good work in a service
in which the use of boats must be largely resorted to;
and that, in order to take a number at a gun mounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>on a raft, such as the  'Nancy Dawson,' which the late
Captain Cole improvised for our naval operations in the
Sea of Azof, or to serve in a gun's crew in a floating
battery for harbour defence, neither sea legs nor sea
experience are indispensable qualifications. For such
duties those qualities are required which equally combine
to make a good gunner and a good soldier,
whether afloat or on shore&mdash;a fair share of physical
strength and activity, intelligence, and, above all,
courage and patriotism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The force need not be numerous.</div>
<p class='c004'>Designed, as the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers
have been, for the especial work of coast and harbour
defence, it is not necessary that the corps should be
very numerous. It certainly need not exceed the
numbers of our amateur yachtsmen and oarsmen, for
whom the opportunity, now offered, of taking their
share in the national defence, is chiefly intended.
Enough will have been done, if a brigade can be
formed at each of the principal ports, of a strength
varying from 200 to 600 men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The training required.</div>
<p class='c004'>Having described the general scope of the duties,
which would devolve on the Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteers, in the event of their being called out for
actual service, the nature of the training proposed for
the members of the force may be briefly explained.
The first consideration must be to familiarise them, to
some extent, with the management of boats. This instruction
might occupy much time in a corps composed
of men, who had never been in the habit of going on
the water; but, as the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>corps is to be recruited in a large proportion from
among aquatics, many of their number may be expected
to possess this qualification without the necessity
for special instruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next point to claim attention will be the exercise
at the great guns. Here I may venture to affirm, from
personal experience, that the naval gun drills have been,
in every detail, so carefully considered, the instructors
are so completely masters of the subject which they
have to teach, and the mechanical appliances are such
effectual substitutes for heavy manual labour, that a
few days of constant attention will suffice to make a
volunteer a useful man in a gun's crew. The class of
recruits required for the Royal Navy Artillery Volunteers
possess advantages of intelligence and education,
far beyond those which the practical seamen can enjoy;
and we may anticipate, from the experience already
acquired, that they will form some of the smartest
gun's crews in any branch of the naval service. There
is neither insurmountable difficulty, nor unduly fatiguing
labour, in the drill at the great guns. The intricacies
could be mastered in a few days, if the
volunteers were kept continuously at drill, as they
necessarily would be, should they ever be called out for
actual service.</p>

<p class='c004'>The essential point in a volunteer corps is to secure
men physically capable of doing their work, and who
may be confidently relied upon as ready to serve,
whenever they may be called upon.</p>

<p class='c004'>The small-arm exercises are still more easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>mastered. A rowing man will find himself able to use
his cutlass efficiently in a few hours; and, after a
couple of days of continuous drill, he would be able to
go through the manual and platoon exercises with
satisfactory smartness and precision.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rowing and yachting gentlemen will perceive that
they will have no difficulty in acquiring the knowledge
of their drills, which is required in order to make them
efficient, in the winter months. They will not find
that their favourite amusements on the water, in the
summer months, are incompatible with service in the
Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Facilities for drill.</div>
<p class='c004'>Every effort will be made to afford to those, who
may be willing to join the Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteers, the necessary facilities for learning their
drills. For the London brigade, the 'Rainbow,' a gun
vessel well adapted for the purpose, is now being fitted
out at Chatham. This vessel will be ready in two
months from the date of this publication; and, when
completed, will be moored in the Thames in a convenient
position, off Somerset House. Should such an arrangement
be found convenient for members of the Corinthian
and other yacht clubs at Erith, it is possible that the
'Rainbow' may be moved, from time to time, to moorings
near the pier at Erith; and, should a desire to
that effect be expressed by the members of the rowing
clubs higher up the Thames, an effort will be made to
move the vessel to moorings near the boat-houses of
any rowing clubs, which have their head-quarters below
Kew Bridge.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>No positive promise, however, can be given that the
'Rainbow' shall be moved. There are many points to
consider, such as draft of water, height and width
of arches, and obstruction of the navigation of the
river.</p>

<p class='c004'>For those clubs which are established still higher
up the river, where there is not sufficient water to float
the 'Rainbow,' facilities for instruction may be provided
by mounting a 64-pounder gun on a raft, which
could be towed from place to place, and moored to the
bank of the river adjacent to the boat-houses belonging
to the clubs. An instructor would accompany the
raft; and, during the winter months, arrangements
might be made for giving to volunteers an opportunity
of going through their small-arm drills in a drill-shed,
or other convenient place, available for the purpose.
Thus it may be found possible to extend the system of
instruction, by effectual, yet inexpensive, means, far up
the Thames, and so to embrace towns such as Reading,
Maidenhead, Henley, Windsor, and even the headquarters
of rowing, the University of Oxford.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inquiry having been made as to whether members
will be expected to appear in uniform, whenever they
attend drill, it may not be superfluous to mention that
the regulations are silent on this point. Members will
only be required to wear uniform on special occasions,
of which due notice will be given.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Regulations as to drill.</div>
<p class='c004'>Members of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteer
corps may therefore rest assured that they will have
the opportunity of being thoroughly instructed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>drills, in which it is considered desirable that they should
be proficient.</p>

<p class='c004'>The drills will comprise those for great guns, rifle,
pistol, and cutlass, as in the Royal Navy, and no deviation
from these drills is to be permitted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Officer-Instructor.</div>
<p class='c004'>All drills will be carried out by the instructor,
attached to the brigades, under the officer-instructor.
The permanent staff of a brigade will consist of an
officer-instructor and one petty officer instructor for
each battery. The officer-instructor will be commissioned
as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteers, and will be selected from officers of or
retired from the Royal Navy, of and above the rank of
lieutenant. He will keep the muster-rolls, and it will
be his duty to make himself acquainted with all the
members of his brigade, and their qualifications. He
will superintend all drills and exercises, and is to have
complete control over the petty officer instructors, and
to be responsible to the Admiralty for their conduct
and efficiency.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Attendances at drill.</div>
<p class='c004'>On the important point of the number of attendances
at drill, the regulations require that every
volunteer must attend at least two drills a month, until
he has obtained the standard of an efficient. An
efficient must be able to perform in a satisfactory
manner the duties of any number except No. 1 at
heavy gun exercise, or at revolving gun exercise, as
applicable to the 64-pounder guns mounted in gunboats;
and he must be possessed of a good knowledge
of the manual, platoon, and cutlass exercises.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Service afloat not compulsory.</div>
<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>It has already been explained that these qualifications
may easily be acquired in a fortnight of continuous
attendance at drill, by the application of a very
ordinary amount of intelligence and attention. The
regulations expressly avoid the imposition of any compulsory
service afloat in time of peace. Target practice
afloat is obviously essential to the efficiency of a naval
gunner; and it is therefore desirable that every
volunteer should have a fair number of opportunities
of taking part in this useful exercise. In a long
summer's day, the members of the London Brigade may
embark in a gunboat at Erith or Gravesend, proceed
to the Maplin Sands, off Shoeburyness&mdash;which is the
most convenient place for firing practice over a sea
range&mdash;and return to London by a convenient hour in
the afternoon or evening. It will doubtless be the
desire of every naval volunteer to avail himself of a
sufficient number of opportunities for target practice,
to secure his own efficiency. But, as there are many
who will be anxious to have a greater amount of
exercise afloat, every volunteer, who wishes it, may
embark once a year, and remain for a period of eight
days in a gunboat, manned by a crew to be furnished
from the battery to which he himself belongs. It
should, however, be observed that, when called out for
actual service, the volunteers will not be liable to
embark in sea-going vessels. Whenever so assembled,
they will serve on board any of H.M, ships employed
in the defence of the coasts of the United Kingdom;
unless, indeed, they volunteer for, and are found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>capable of doing duty in, sea-going cruisers. They
will not be required to go aloft, or to attend to the
fires in the stoke-hole. They will, however, have to
accommodate themselves to the berthing and messing
arrangements usual for the seamen of the Royal Navy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Regulations issued by the Admiralty.</div>
<p class='c004'>The regulations recently issued contain ample
information as to the organisation of the Royal Naval
Artillery Volunteers; and their practical effect will be
summarised in the following extracts from the code
of rules.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Volunteers are raised under the Act passed in
1873. They will be called out by Royal proclamation,
and will be liable to serve in any vessels employed for
coast defence. They will be liable to perform all the
ordinary duties of the vessels in which they may be
embarked, in the same manner as those duties are performed
by the regular crews of Her Majesty's ships,
except those duties that can only be performed by
practical seamen.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Royal Naval Artillery Volunteer force, for
administrative purposes, will be formed into brigades,
and each brigade will consist of four or more batteries
of from 60 to 80 men. Each brigade will be designated
by a local name.</p>

<p class='c004'>Persons wishing to organise a corps to form part of a
brigade of Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers should
place themselves in communication with the Secretary
of the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whenever it is practicable, a brigade will be formed
at each of the large ports in the kingdom, and the
batteries composing the brigade will be raised in the
immediate neighbourhood of the port.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the Volunteers are not of sufficient strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>at any port to form a brigade, the batteries enrolled on
a part of the coast formed into a district will be formed
into a brigade, and will be called a district brigade.</p>

<p class='c004'>The object of this organisation is to unite separate
batteries under one head, to secure uniformity among
them, and to afford them the advantage of an officer-instructor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Candidates for enrolment as members of the Royal
Naval Artillery Volunteers must be of good character,
and physically fit for the service; their eligibility will
be judged by the commanding officer of the corps,
assisted by such others of the corps as he may think
fit to appoint for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>No person below the age of 17 is to be enrolled
in the corps without the special authority of the
Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boys of 14 years of age and upwards may be enrolled
for the purpose of being trained as buglers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Men belonging to any other force liable to be called
out for service in case of war are not to be enrolled.</p>

for misconduct are not to be enrolled without the special
sanction of the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The commanding officer of a corps is to give to
any Volunteer, on his quitting the corps, a certificate

<p class='c004'>In each battery there will be, as it has already been
stated, one chief petty officer, two 1st class, and two
2nd class petty officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The petty officers of a battery will be selected by
the commanding officer of the battery.</p>

<p class='c004'>When assembled for drill or inspection, the Volunteers
will be under the command of the senior naval
officer of the district. When the Volunteers are
assembled for drill, the senior officer will be represented
by the officer instructor, a retired commander or
gunnery lieutenant of the Royal Navy, whose duty it
will be to see that all drills are properly carried out.</p>

<p class='c004'>When afloat, the Volunteers are to be, in all matters
whatsoever, under the command of the captain or commanding
officer of the ship in which they may be.</p>

<p class='c004'>The authority of the officers commanding batteries
is strictly limited to their own batteries only. The
discipline will be the same throughout the corps, and
will be enforced by the lieutenant commanding the
brigade, in conformity with the regulations issued by
the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant commanding will make arrangements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>for drill, securing, so far as it may be necessary, separate
hours for each battery. Before adopting any final
arrangements for drill, he will confer with the officer
instructor.</p>

<p class='c004'>There may be an occasional general muster of the
corps, when considered necessary by the lieutenant
commanding.</p>

<p class='c004'>The batteries will take precedence at general
parades according to their numbers, and not according
to the seniority of their respective commanding officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The brigade staff will not be attached to a battery,
but will act under the lieutenant commanding only.</p>

<p class='c004'>Officers of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers

Royal Naval Reserve of their respective ranks.</p>

for the consideration of the Admiralty, names of
persons for the appointments and promotion of officers
in their brigades.</p>

<p class='c004'>The appointment of an honorary commander to a
brigade is allowed, and such honorary lieutenants and
sub-lieutenants as the Admiralty may think fit to sanction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Officers in full pay in the Navy or Army are not
eligible for other than honorary commissions.</p>

<p class='c004'>The uniform approved for the officers resembles
generally that worn by officers of the Naval Reserve,
silver being substituted for gold lace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The officers of the corps.</div>
<p class='c004'>The principle upon which the Volunteers should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>officered has been one of the most frequent subjects of
discussion among those who have associated themselves
with the movement from the commencement, and who
have been provisionally enrolled, with the sanction of
the Admiralty, in anticipation of the passing of the Act
of Parliament of last year.</p>

<p class='c004'>A desire has been expressed that no officers should
be appointed to the corps, but that the Volunteers
should serve only under direct naval command. Practically,
the desire, so strongly felt, has been fulfilled in
the arrangements which have actually been made.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whenever called upon to serve afloat, or when
embarked for the purpose of training, the Volunteers
will be under the command of the officer, commanding
the ship, in which they may be. When embarked for
their first cruise in the autumn of the present year, the
arrangements were, of necessity, experimental and provisional.
There was a natural desire on the part of the
officer commanding the 'Foam' to meet the wishes of
the Volunteers themselves in every possible way, consistent
with the efficient performance of the service,
and the carrying on of the drills and exercises required.
The same considerate spirit will doubtless prevail on all
future occasions; but the Volunteers, who make themselves
acquainted with the regulations, will clearly
perceive that, whenever they embark, they place themselves
under direct naval authority; and that, when
afloat, their own officers are never to assume any naval
command or authority whatever, unless ordered to do
so by their superior naval officers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The officers of the Volunteers will do their utmost
to assist the naval officers to preserve discipline. They
may, if they think fit, set an example to their men by
taking an active part in all the duties and manual
exercises. They may fall in at quarters, and take any
number at the gun. In short, they may become, as
much as they please, active working seamen and efficient
practical gunners. It is for them to use their own discretion
in determining how much or how little they
shall participate in the manual labour, involved in
carrying out the drills and exercises ordered by the
naval officers in command.</p>

<p class='c004'>When at drill, as it has already been pointed out,
the officer-instructor will superintend the instruction of
the Volunteers, and he will be responsible that all
exercises are properly carried out, in accordance with
the regulations from time to time laid down for the instruction
of the Royal Navy. It will thus be evident
that the paramount and undivided authority of the
naval officers over the Volunteers when afloat, and the
superior responsibility of the officer of instruction when
the Volunteers are at drill, so largely overshadow the
authority of the officers of the Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteers in all matters, excepting those which relate
to discipline and the civil administration and organisation
of the corps, that it could not reasonably be expected
that retired naval officers of rank should
volunteer to become battery officers in the Royal
Naval Artillery Volunteer Corps. Naval officers of
less exalted rank do not often retire, if they have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>great zeal for the service. Some exceptions, however,
there must be to this general rule; and it is probable
that a certain number of retired officers from the junior
ranks of the Navy will, hereafter, kindly offer their
services to command brigades or batteries in the ports
or districts, in which they may happen to reside. The
Volunteers will at all times feel a pride in availing
themselves of such opportunities of acting under
officers, who have received a high professional training
in Her Majesty's naval service.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the effect of the arrangements, which have
been described, necessarily limits the sphere of the
officers of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers, their
services, in several important points, are not the less
essential. It is to them that the Admiralty must look
for the exercise of their personal influence, in inducing
recruits to join their respective brigades and
batteries; and their moral influence will be the principal
security for the maintenance of good discipline in
a force composed exclusively of Volunteers. Although,
under the regulations, no fixed standard of efficiency is
expressly required in an officer of the Royal Naval
Artillery Volunteer force, those among them, who can
command sufficient leisure for the purpose, will readily
appreciate how excellent an effect must be produced
by the personal example of an officer, who will take
pains to make himself acquainted with the drills and
exercises, in which the men under his command are
instructed. He will have the opportunity of obtaining
the same certificate of proficiency, which is given to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>those officers of the Naval Reserve, who become qualified
to drill the seamen of the reserve at the great guns,
and in the small arm exercises.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the view of enlisting, in support of the Naval
Volunteer movement, the potent influences which are
derived from the esprit de corps, wherever it may
reasonably and prudently be encouraged, it is proposed
to associate certain batteries in the London brigade
with some of the principal rowing and Corinthian
yacht clubs on the Thames, and to give commissions
to any gentlemen, otherwise eligible, who are instrumental
in raising a full battery of Naval Volunteers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The rowing and Corinthian yacht clubs.</div>
<p class='c004'>The following list of some of the principal rowing
clubs, will serve to show the large number of gentlemen,
from whom assistance may be expected, in promoting
the success of a movement for extending the
Volunteer service to a certain sphere of naval operations;</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The Corinthian yacht clubs on the Thames are
equally able to render assistance, and are indeed
capable of raising, if they think fit, an entire brigade
for the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteer Corps.</p>

<p class='c004'>The resources of the clubs located on the banks of
the Thames have been particularly specified; because
the present writer, in his connection with the movement
under consideration, is more immediately identified
with that river. Readers of these pages, residing
in the vicinity of any of our great ports, will doubtless
be able to discover equally ample materials for
the foundation of a sufficient force, for the purposes of
co-operation in the defence of the coast, in their own
neighbourhood. A corps, though it may be raised at
some distance from the sphere of its intended operations,
in the event of threatened invasion, will not be
the less valuable for the defence of a great port.</p>

<p class='c004'>The railway and the telegraph afford the means of
concentrating large bodies of men in a few hours at
any port on the shores of the United Kingdom.
Wherever the coast-guard are stationed, the means
exist of giving instruction to the Naval Volunteers.
All the out-ports, at which men have been enrolled,
can be visited by a gunboat at frequent intervals, to
embark the Volunteers for target practice afloat; while
those who wish to go to sea for an eight days' cruise,
will have, every year, the opportunity of doing so.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Volunteer movement.</div>
<p class='c004'>In conclusion, it may not be superfluous to offer a
few observations on the Volunteer movement generally.
The most cogent inducements to Volunteer activity may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>appear to be wanting at the present time. Our country
is happily not threatened with the danger of foreign
invasion. A becoming modesty will deter any individual
connected with the Volunteer service from
arrogating to himself any share in the prestige and
distinction, which are the special privilege of the
regular services. It is an essential feature of the
present movement that there shall be no contribution
from the state in the form of pecuniary reward for
services rendered; and that every effort shall be made
by the Volunteers to impose as small a burden as
possible on the Exchequer. The sterner sense of duty,
which is now encouraged among the Volunteers for
land service, is opposed to all attempts to gain popularity
for the auxiliary forces by festivals, holidays, and
entertainments.</p>

<p class='c004'>While, however, all these inducements and attractions
are withheld, a higher standard of efficiency in
the officers and the men is properly insisted on. In
presence of the difficulties which arise from the altered
conditions of the service, some earnest friends of the
Volunteer movement have been oppressed with doubts,
as to the possibility of stimulating the patriotism of the
country to such a pitch, that Volunteers shall still be
forthcoming in a time of profound peace. I do not
conceal my individual opinion that compulsory service
may fairly be required, from every individual of military
age, when the country is in danger. Unfortunately, so
strong a measure would probably meet with an amount
of resistance, which could not be overcome in this free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>country, where nothing affecting the social habits and
prejudices of the people can be proposed, which is not
universally popular. But I venture to hope that we
may rely, in the absence of direct legal compulsion, on
motives even more powerful than the strong arm of the
law. If every man who is capable of co-operating in
the defence of his country should feel himself compelled,
by his sense of duty and patriotism, to enter his
name in the roll of her defenders, the liability to service,
thus imposed by the free will of the Volunteer upon
himself, will be a far more effectual safeguard than legal
compulsion, for the security and the honour of England.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Volunteer movement affords the occasion for
teaching, in the most practical form, the duty of self-sacrifice
in a worthy cause.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the artificial conditions of modern society, there
are multitudes of men, who, in the ordinary exercise of
their vocation, are unduly deprived of the opportunities
for physical exercise and development. More especially
is this true of the younger members of the professional
and commercial classes. To them an appeal is
now most earnestly made on behalf of the Royal Naval
Artillery Volunteers. In taking a part in our drills and
exercises, they will do a work beneficial to themselves
individually, and conducive to the welfare of their
country.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>N.B.&mdash;Any gentlemen wishing to join the Royal
Naval Artillery Volunteers, may communicate with Mr.
Thomas Brassey, M.P., or Commander St. Vincent
Nepean, R.N., at the temporary head-quarters, 4, Great
George Street, Westminster. The regular drills of the
corps will not be commenced until the drill vessel 'Rainbow'
has been moored off Somerset House, and all other
arrangements have been completed. Gentlemen are
earnestly invited to send in their names, in the meanwhile,
provisionally, so that the organisation of the
brigade may be completed at an early date; and that
the movement at the out-ports may be encouraged by
the example of the metropolis.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Course to be pursued for the formation of a new Corps.</div>
<p class='c004'>8. Persons wishing to form a Corps to form part of a
Brigade of Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers should place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>themselves in communication with the Secretary of the
Admiralty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason for formation.</div>
<p class='c004'>9. The Admiralty, in considering offers of the services of
a new Corps, will have regard to the number of Corps or
Batteries already existing on the same part of the Coast
where the proposed Corps would be.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>New Corps not to be formed under certain circumstances.</div>
<p class='c004'>10. The formation of a new Corps will not be sanctioned,
unless a sufficient number of persons to form a
Battery are prepared to enrol themselves, and whilst any
Battery already existing in the locality is below its establishment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Information to be given on application.</div>
<p class='c004'>11. In offering the services of a new Corps for acceptance,
it should be stated:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>a</i>) The place proposed for its head-quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>b</i>) The number of persons who are prepared to
enrol themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>c</i>) The name and address of some person with whom
communications on the subject may be made.</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>d</i>) The Brigade of which it will form a part.</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>e</i>) That a proper place will be secured for the safe
custody of any Government arms and ammunition
which may be issued.</p>

<p class='c004'>(Form in Appendix A.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Single Brigade.</div>
<p class='c004'>12. Whenever it is practicable, a Brigade will be
formed at each of the large ports in the Kingdom, and
the batteries composing the Brigade will be raised in the
immediate neighbourhood of the port.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>District Brigade.</div>
<p class='c004'>When the Volunteers are not of sufficient strength at
any port to form a Brigade, the batteries enrolled on a
part of the coast formed into a district, will be formed into
a Brigade, and will be called a District Brigade.</p>

<p class='c004'>The object of this organization is to unite separate
batteries under one head, to secure uniformity among
them, and to afford them the advantage of an Officer
Instructor.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>COURTS OF INQUIRY.</h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Nature of.</div>
<p class='c004'>45. A Court of Inquiry is not a judicial body; it has no
power to administer an oath.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is to be considered as a Board of which the Admiralty
or an Officer in command of a Brigade or Corps may make
use, to assist him in arriving at a correct judgment on any
subject upon which it may be expedient to institute an
inquiry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Duties of.</div>
<p class='c004'>46. The duties of a Court of Inquiry depend on the
instructions which the convening authority may think
proper to give.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may be either employed merely in collecting and
arranging evidence, or it may, in addition, be directed to
give an opinion as to the facts established by that evidence;
but it has no power to pronounce any judgment as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>course to be taken by the convening authority in dealing
with those facts.</p>

<p class='c004'>When facts connected with the conduct of an individual
are submitted to the investigation of a Court of Inquiry,
it is necessary that the instructions for the guidance of
the Court should be sufficiently specific, as regards matter,
names, dates, and places, to convey clearly to the Court
the nature of the subject into which it is appointed to
inquire, and also to enable the person whose conduct is
called in question to know what he has to answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>It rests with the authority who orders the assembly of
the Court of Inquiry to decide whether it shall be open or
closed.</p>

<p class='c004'>All evidence taken by a Court of Inquiry is to be recorded
as nearly as possible in the words of the witness
and in the order in which it is received.</p>

<p class='c004'>The proceedings when closed are to be signed by the
President and Members, after which they are to be forwarded
by the President to the convening authority.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>May be re-assembled.</div>
<p class='c004'>47. A Court of Inquiry may be re-assembled as often
as the superior authority may deem necessary, and on every
occasion of its meeting it is competent to receive and record
new evidence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Power of Commanding Officer to assemble.</div>
<p class='c004'>The Commanding Officer of a Brigade is authorised to
assemble a Court of Inquiry, to investigate any matter
with which he himself has the power of dealing.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>DISCIPLINE.</h3>

<p class='c012'>48. The course to be adopted as to the Discipline of
the Volunteers will be found in Part III of the Naval
Artillery Volunteers Act.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Meetings not to be held on Actions of Superiors.</div>
<p class='c004'>49. Meetings are not to be held in the Corps for the
purpose of expressing an opinion upon the acts of a Commanding
Officer, or of recommending him to take a particular
course of action; nor are memorials to be drawn up
to the same effect; and no meetings except those called
together by or under the authority of the Commanding
Officer of a Brigade or Corps, who will be responsible for
doing so, will be recognised.</p>

<p class='c004'>If any Volunteer has cause to think himself aggrieved,
he will represent his case to the Commanding Officer of
his Battery. Any appeal against the decision of the Commanding
Officer of the Battery will be made through
him to the Commander of the Brigade, and any further
appeal will be made through both these officers to the
Admiralty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Not to attend political meetings in uniform.</div>
<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>50. Members of the Force are not, individually or collectively,
to attend political meetings, or join in public
political discussion or demonstrations in uniform.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bands of music.</div>
<p class='c004'>51. Bands of Volunteer Brigades are not to appear in
uniform, for any purpose, without the consent of the Commanding
Officer of the Brigade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Permanent Staff not to receive presents.</div>
<p class='c004'>52. Members of the Permanent Staff will be held
responsible that they do not allow themselves to be complimented,
either directly or indirectly, by presents or
collective expressions of opinion from persons who are
serving or who have served in the Brigade to which they
are attached.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Volunteers to salute Superiors of all Services.</div>
<p class='c004'>53. Officers and men of the Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteers, when in uniform, are to pay the customary
marks of respect to such Officers of the Navy, Army, and
Auxiliary Forces as are entitled to be saluted by Officers
and men of corresponding rank in their own Service.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Officers to observe and enforce all Regulations.</div>
<p class='c004'>54. Every Officer and Petty Officer shall make himself
acquainted with and shall duly observe and obey, and as
far as in him lies, enforce the due execution of the "Royal
Naval Artillery Volunteer Act, 1873," and the Regulations
for the "Royal Naval Artillery Volunteer Force," together
with all Regulations, Instructions, and Orders, which may
from time to time be given or issued by the Admiralty, or
by any Superior Officer, and shall in all respects conform
his conduct to the customs and usages of Her Majesty's
Naval Service.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Discipline in Camp.</div>
<p class='c004'>55. When Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers are assembled
with the Regular Forces of the Army in Camp or for
training, they will be under the "Naval Discipline Act,
1866," in the same manner as if they were on actual
service, and will be placed under the immediate command
of an Officer of Her Majesty's Navy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Camp rules will apply in all respects to the Royal
Naval Artillery Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Naval Volunteers must perform the Camp duties
of fatigue, cooking, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case of misconduct when training to be reported.</div>
<p class='c004'>56. In case of grave misconduct of any of the Royal
Naval Artillery Volunteers whilst on board any of H.M.
ships for the purpose of training, the Officer in command
of the ship will report the circumstance to the Admiralty
through the usual channel.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>ASSEMBLIES OF THE FORCE.</h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Conditions on which to meet under Arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>57. The Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers are not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>assemble under arms for any purpose unconnected with
Parade, Drill, or Rifle practice, except with the approval of
the Admiralty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Brigaded with other Forces.</div>
<p class='c004'>58. The Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers may, when
circumstances permit, be brigaded with other Forces, the
sanction of the Admiralty having been previously obtained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Visiting Garrison or Camp.</div>
<p class='c004'>59. When any of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers
desire to visit any Garrison or Camp as a naval body, the
permission of the Secretary at War must first be obtained
through the Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon all occasions of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers
entering a Garrison or Camp as a body, the Officer
in command must duly report his arrival to the Senior
Naval Officer present, or, if there is not one, he will wait
on the Officer in command of the Garrison or Camp.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Command at Rifle Shooting Matches.</div>
<p class='c004'>60. When the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers are
brought together under arms at Rifle Shooting Matches,
on other occasions, with other Volunteer Corps, or with
any of Her Majesty's Land Forces on shore, the Officer in
Command of the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers, present,
shall take care that everyone under his command complies
with all the Regulations of the Land Forces relative to the
Camp or ground on which they may be, and he shall
confer with the Senior Officer of the Land Forces, and act
in concert with him, so that the Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteer may in all cases act in accordance with the
orders under which the Land Forces are acting; but it is
to be distinctly understood that nothing in this Regulation
is to give a claim to any Officer of Her Majesty's Navy, or
of any Naval Volunteer Corps, to assume command of any
of Her Majesty's Land Forces, nor to any Officer of Her
Majesty's Land Forces to assume command of any of Her
Majesty's Naval Forces.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Surplus ammunition to be collected.</div>
<p class='c004'>61. When the Volunteers, at the termination of an
exercise, are to return by railway or boat to their head-quarters,
the arms are to be examined, and all the ammunition
which has not been expended must be collected and
placed in a metal or leather case, with a view to its being
conveyed in safety to the head-quarters.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Responsibility for and care of.</div>
<p class='c004'>62. The Commanding Officer of a Corps is responsible
to the Admiralty for all stores which are supplied by
Government for the use of the Corps.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arms to be supplied by Government.</div>
<p class='c004'>63.  Each Corps will be supplied gratuitously with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>arms from the Government stores to the full number of its
enrolled members, if required.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Description of arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>64. The arms to be supplied are in Appendix C.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Armouries to be available before arms are supplied.</div>
<p class='c004'>65. Before any Government arms can be issued, it is
necessary that the Admiralty shall be satisfied that one or
more places of security for the custody of the arms have
been provided at the expense of the Volunteers. The
Drill Ships, Coast Guard Stations, or Police Stations will
probably be available in some places for the purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Application for arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>66. Commanding Officers of Corps are to apply for
the arms required in the prescribed Form of Requisition
given in Appendix D, addressed to the Secretary of the
Admiralty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Marking arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>67. The arms of a Brigade will be marked previously
to their issue, and a request to that effect is to be inserted
in the requisition on which the arms are demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>No other marks than those on them when issued are on
any account to be put on the arms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Responsibility for arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>68. All arms issued to the Corps remain the property
of Her Majesty's Government, and the Commanding Officer
for the time being is held responsible for their being at all
times in a serviceable state, and for their being returned
into store when required in good condition, fair wear and
tear excepted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cleaning and care of arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>69. Great attention should be paid to the proper cleaning
and care of the arms entrusted to the Volunteers, and
the Commanding Officers are to point out to those under
their command that, should rust be allowed to accumulate
on any part of a rifle, it must inevitably impair the accuracy
and efficiency of the weapon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Depositing arms.</div>
<p class='c004'>70. The arms are to be deposited after drill in the
armouries of the Brigade or Corps, except when the Commanding
Officer may judge it expedient to permit members
of the Brigade to keep their arms at their own
houses.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the Commanding Officer is responsible for the

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
